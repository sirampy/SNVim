This is my neovim config, aimed to be a relatively un-bloated compared to a lot of the more popular "off the shelf" configs available, whilst still providing enough functionality to be a viable IDE.

# Installing

clone into ~/.config/nvim/
install Lazy.nvim (clone it into ~/.config/nvim/install/lazy.nvim/

# Notes

This cofig is intended for my personal use and is always a work-in-progress / missing a lot of obviously good ideas (EG: install script / having all packages configured "properly") and may be somewhat hacky in places.
